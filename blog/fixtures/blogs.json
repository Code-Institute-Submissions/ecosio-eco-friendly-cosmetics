            "intro_paragraph": "Alcohol or aloe vera? Just going out on a limb here - but, a soothing, cooling agent like aloe vera seems much more appealing than stinging alcohol on freshly shaven skin. So - why do so many post-shave products out there have alcohol as the base for their formulas?",
            "subheading_1": "Why Alcohol?",
            "blog_content_1": "The reason alcohol is included in post-shave products is due to it's astringent and antiseptic properties. The purpose of using alcohol is to tighten skin pores and prevent infection after shaving. The problem with this is that alcohol also can exacerbate razor burn and make it challenging for your skin to retain crucial moisture. Even worse, alcohol can, in some cases, tighten skin to a point where the dryness creates a barrier-like surface. This barrier makes it difficult for hair to pierce through the skin layer, leading to the development of ingrown hairs. Long story short, the use of alcohol may have a few benefits but will cause unnecessary irritation to those prone to sensitive skin or razor burn.",
            "subheading_2": "Bring on the Aloe & Witch Hazel",
            "blog_content_2": "So, the question becomes if there is a way to add more natural ingredients into a post-shave formula with the astringent and antiseptic properties that alcohol totes. And the short answer is yes.  Witch hazel is a plant that has natural astringent properties. It helps calm irritation that occurs after shaving, stop any bleeding present, and disinfect any nicks that may have occurred. Plus, it won't cause a stinging sensation after application. Aloe vera is more than just a product you grab after spending one too many hours at the beach. It is a powerful, plant-based ingredient that moisturizes, soothes skin, prevents irritation, and calms any redness. With the combined power of witch hazel and aloe vera, skin not only feels better. It looks better too.",

While other brands are filling their moisturizers with water to dilute the formula, we're jamming our's full of aloe vera. Just check out the first ingredient. And the best part? It doesn't only work as a moisturizer for people with dry skin. Since aloe vera absorbs easily, it's also a great choice for those prone to oily skin, making it the ultimate skin rejuvenator.",

A mask is only as effective as it's fit, so using it correctly is paramount.",

            "blog_content_1": "It seems a given, but it has to be stated. If you're wanting to protect yourself, leaving that mask in your pocket is going to do you no favors. Wear it in public places or crowds as you go out. Plus, one of the biggest mistakes of wearing a mask is only having it cover your mouth and chin. Proper fitting masks should mold at the top on the bridge of your nose while closely hugging below your chin. Most importantly, a snug but breathable fit seals off the bottom half of your face, offering the most protection during these strange times.",

            "blog_content_2": "One thing to point out is the length of your facial hair while wearing a mask will affect its fit. To maintain a proper seal, the edges need to be firmly fitted around your face and pressed up against your skin. If the mask is sitting on your facial hair, which is an uneven surface, your seal may be compromised. Some medical professionals even claim that hair breaks the seal and makes it useless in protecting you. For some background, essential workers who wear the N95 mask are required to have a yearly fit test under US regulations. The thing is that a proper fit is tested only on cleanly shaven faces, while even sideburns can get in the way. So, a BBS shave all over your face is the way to go here. Luckily, we know a thing or two about shave prep. #humblebrag",

            "blog_content_3": "If your WFH lifestyle has kept you from being clean-shaven for a bit, it's important you take your time with your pre-shave routine. Warm water is your best friend for prepping your shave. If time permits, start with a nice, warm shower. The combo of heat and steam will soften your hair while simultaneously opening up skin pores, making it an easier shave on your face. If you don't have time for a shower, grab a damp, warm towel to prep your skin pores. Add in a light massage to your face with the towel to gently lift and prep hair. If you have one, using a shaving brush with warm water while you apply your shaving cream is also a great way to exfoliate and prep for that close shave. Then, follow up with a single blade to minimize the irritation and friction with your skin and reap the benefits of a close, comfortable shave."

            "blog_content_2": "Aside from creating an amazing lather, a shave brush will also prepare your hair and skin for a better shave. When applying lather with a brush, the warm, soapy water combines with your circular motions to actually lift your facial hair away from the skin. This places them in the perfect position to be swept away by a sharp, single blade with minimal irritation. Why this is important: When hairs lay flat against your skin, it's much harder for the blade to cut it, leaving behind stubble and patches of hair. This requires multiple passes to get the close shave you want but at the risk of razor burn or irritation.",

            "blog_content_3": "An added bonus to using a shave brush is the much-needed exfoliation it provides to worn skin.

Plus if you're using warm water with it, the brush will actually open up your skin pores, lowering your chances of ingrown hairs and irritation. Win. Win."

            "blog_content_1": "How bad can disposable razors be for the environment? Seems harmless, but the facts could not be any more opposite or alarming. The average disposable razor lasts around 6-9 shaves, after which the blade has dulled and is destined for the trash bin.

Imagine for a second if everyone took up plastic free shaving. More than 3 billion disposable razors would be eliminated from our landfills. 3 billion with a B. And that's not all. The magnitude of CO2 emissions eliminated in our air would have a lasting impact. Got your attention? Here's how we can do better.",

            "blog_content_3": "Choosing a razor made out of sustainable materials will keep it out of the trash and can even be more enjoyable. We recommend looking for razors made with all metal construction for their ease in recycling. Pay attention to your blade refills. Plastic disposable razors are not the only culprit in clogging our landfills. The plastic blade refills are just as much to blame. Many razor companies purposely design their blades to dull after just a few shaves, causing you to come back and purchase more refills that often come with a hefty price tag. It's time to stop settling for mediocre shaves and adding to plastic waste. There's no need for extra blades and cheap, plastic construction. Invest once and reap a lifetime of epic shaves. Your face will thank you."

If your bin is mainly full of paper towels, try reusable towels. If you use a new plastic water bottle every day, invest in a reusable stainless-steel bottle, … you get the idea.
