## Defensive Design and Predicted Error Points

In this chapter I will focus more on which steps I've taken to prevent predicted errors and complications. In the beginning I focused
more on the actions that could break the site or site structure completely, and afterwards more on restrictions that would make
sense for this project in general.

### Custom Error Webpages
* includes error 400, 403, 404 and 500
* since errors do happen anyways, no matter how well the defensive design has been thought through, I believe custom error pages are better for the user experience
* these pages inform the user of the error that has just happen but at the same time don't disrupt the user's mindset by a sudden change of environment (brand-friendly to foreign page design) and they support user's journey throughout the app better (by having links to return to other parts of the web app)

### Secured Admin Views
* admin-related activities happening on the site, such as adding, editing and deleting products or blog posts - are secured for superusers
* if a user still tries to access those pages, they are redirected to the homepage with a toast saying that only ECOSiO's team is allowed to do these actions
* this has been done by:
    * importing `@login_required` decorator in `views.py` files
    * redirecting to the homepage
    * displaying error toast message

![Secured Admin Views](readme-files/img-testing/img-testing-admin-rights.png)

### Modals When Permanently Deleting Data
* some admin-related activities such as deleting products and blog posts are permanent
* a modal will pop up to double check whether a user really wants to do such action or not
* when it comes to removing items from the cart, no modal appears since this is not a permanent action and products can easily be re-added to the cart

![Modals](readme-files/img-testing/img-testing-modal.png)

### Search Queries Safe for Site Structure
* firstly, if the query is an empty string, users are redirected to the webshop with a toast message
* long search queries without white spaces, or search queries that are simply too long, could break the site's responsiveness and structure
* for that reason, the following actions have been taken:
    * search box `<input>` is restricted to `maxlength="50"`
    * search term in breadcrumbs is restricted to `{{ search_term|truncatechars:25 }}`
    * search term length on the page is limited by `{{ search_term|truncatechars:50 }}`
* this also helps with link manipulation demonstrated below, in case users try to type the search query directly in the link so that the restrictions mentioned earlier are avoided

![Search Query Link Manipulation](readme-files/img-testing/img-testing-search-link-manipulation.png)

### Maximum Items per Order - 150
* a user can order up to 150 items per order
* the code can be found in `views.py` in the `cart` app
* in short, the system sums the quantity of items that are already in the cart with the quantity that is being submitted to the cart
* if the calculated sum is higher than the limit (150 products), the user gets a toast message that this is not possible and gets redirected to the same page they were on
* an example of this error would be when there are 140 products in the cart and the user tries to add 20 more items (new total would be 160 which is higher than the limit of 150)

![Max 150 Items per Order](readme-files/img-testing/img-testing-cart-max-150.png)

### Maximum Same Products per Order - 99
* when it comes to individual products per order, a user can order up to 99 same items
* products can be added to the cart at 4 places within the web app:
    * by clicking 'add to cart` button on the homepage ('our most popular products' section)
    * by clicking 'add to cart` button in the webshop's product feed (product cards)
    * by defining product's quantity through the input field on the product page (+/- input field) and confirming by clicking on the 'add to cart` button
    * by clicking 'add to cart` button on the product page ('recommended for you' section)
* the code can be found in `views.py` in the `cart` app
* in short, the system checks if the product's ID is already in the cart, takes its quantity, sums it with the quantity that is being submitted and compares it to the limit of 99 same items per order
* if the amount is higher than 99, and the general limit of maximum 150 products per order hasn't been reached, the system changes the current quantity to maximum 99 items in the cart and alerts the user of the changes
* an example of this error would be when there are 89 products in the cart already and the user tries to add 20 more on top of that through the product page input box (new total would be 109 which is higher than the limit of 99) - the system rounds the quantity to 99 instead of 109

![Max 99 Same Items per Order](readme-files/img-testing/img-testing-cart-max-99.png)

### User-Frienly Product Page Input
* product pages work a bit differently when it comes to adding products to the cart than the 'add to cart' buttons
* 'add to cart' buttons will increase the quantity of the product by 1, while on product pages, users can submit a bulk number which might be prone to manipulation
* for that reason, the following actions have been taken:
    * the `<input>` tag takes in only numbers as value (`type="number"`) between `min="1"` and `max="99"`
    * if users try to submit empty value, they are redirected to the product page with a toast message

![Product Page Input Manipulation](readme-files/img-testing/img-testing-product-page-input-manipulation.png)

### Cart Adjustments
* similar code has been implemented in the `cart` app as well - a user can't adjust a product's quantity to higher than 99 nor exceed the 150 products in total per order
* however, if users 'update' the cart item to the same number, a toast message appears informing them no changes have been made
* since no errors have technically been made here, I thought this might be a small help in case the user actually tried to change the amount of the product but ended up with the same amount anyhow
* the code can be found in `views.py` in the `cart` app

### Product and Blog Images
* additional precautions were taken when uploading new products and blog posts
* new products have image as an optional field in their model - if there is no image uploaded, a generic `no_image.png` is used as a placeholder
* when it comes to blogs, their images are also header images, so I've made that a mandatory field in the model
* it could happen that the blog image gets deleted from AWS bucket for example - if that happens a simple JavaScript code replaces the images with a `no_image_blog.png` file
```bash
// handle broken blog header images
$('.blog-header-image').on("error", function() {
    $(this).attr('src', '/media/no_image_blog.png');
});
```

### Manipulating Loyalty Points Donation
* registered users that have collected at least 61 loyalty points and unlocked level-2 feature of donating points might try to manipulate this feature
* the users donate points by clicking on the cause they want to contribute to
* the same could be done by typing links into the browser, such as:
    * `http://ecosio.herokuapp.com/profile/donate_plant_tree/`
* this particular action would donate 2 loyalty points to planting a tree with ECOSiO
* users could potentially try to keep on 'donating' their points until they reach either points in negative values, or 0 - which would be their access to a new 10% discount valid only for first orders, i.e. users with no loyalty points
* this has been handled in `profiles` app `views.py` file, where a rule has been added that you cannot donate points if you have less than 61 points
* this way a user can still make donations by typing a link but at least it's not possible to do this endlessly, the feature is available to only level-2 and level-3 users as imagined and, in the end, the user is only losing their own points and benefits - so hopefully no one would want to do this to themselves anyways in the first place
* if users with less than 61 loyalty points try to access the donations via link, the system redirect them to the same page and shows a toast message informing them they don't have enough points to do the action

## Testing

The project's code was frequently validated through:

* [W3 HTML validator](https://validator.w3.org/)
    * the validator found some mistakes that were easy to fix, such as:
        * empty `<h1>` tag
        * unnecessary type attribute `<script type="text/javascript">`
        * having `<div>` tag as child of the `<button>` tag
        * having `<div>` tag as child of the `<ul>` tag
    * and there were a few errors that I haven't fixed yet due to the shortage of time
        * admin views for the `blog` page and the product feed (webshop) have duplicated `id` attributes because of the bootstrap modal
        * the form in admin `add_product` view has two `id` attributes for the image input, it happened because of additional implementation of custom widget template code
        * `cart` page has duplicated `id` attributes as well for the 'delete from cart' functionality, it happened because some parts of the code were hidden on smaller devices so the code appears twice on the page
* [W3 CSS validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)
    * all errors and warning shown are related to either Bootstrap's css file, CSS browser prefixes or CSS variables that I've used (which is too advanced for this validator)
* [JSHint](https://jshint.com/)
    * apart from minor changes, like missing semicolons, everything was all right ('$' was not defined by JSHint however)
* [PEP8 validator](http://pep8online.com/)
    * all Python code was run through the PEP8 validator
    * the only errors I've found were slightly off indentation, which is corrected now, and `line too long` errors, which I plan to correct at later point since this isn't technically an error and this task would be very time-consuming at this point

The web app was tested on the devices and browsers listed below. I loaded the page on each of the device and browser combination
and looked for any visual and functional errors. I've also tried to resize the web pages on desktop in Chrome, Firefox, Opera and
Safari developer tools to look for hidden irregularities and finding out the solutions. More about the errors I've encountered can
be found under the 'Bugs, Problems and Vulnerabilities' section.

* additionally, do a test transaction to see if the new details are correctly displayed in the checkout form

### User Testing Results

Apart from my own efforts, the web app was tested by my friends and family members. The feedback was in general highly positive.
There was one issue that I fixed immediately, which was increasing the size of the delete icon on the `cart` page on mobile devices.
This feature removes a product from the cart but since it was so small, it was difficult to click directly on it. As the icon is on top of
the product image which is linked to the product page of that product, it would often happen that the user ended up there and had to go
back to the cart. I've fixed this by:
* increasing the icon's size
* increasing the clickable area around the icon

There were also minor styling suggestions like adding more padding and margins to some elements.

Other suggestions I've got would require more time, bigger code refactoring or simply careful and detailed planning to achieve them.
Since none of these were actually bugs or errors and users have quickly realised how the web app works, I've decided to leave them
for later improvements of the MVP. The suggestions were:
* removing the paragraph CTAs like 'Register Here' from the `homepage` for logged in users
* two users suggested removing the 'update' link from `cart` and that the item updating should happen whenever a `+/-` input field is clicked on
* keeping the 'Sort Products By' filter in the webshop even after clicking on a category or a product tag filter
* toast doesn't disapear if hovered so that the user has more time reading it
* user can combine filters in the webshop, such as 'Skincare' and '100% Organic'
* adding tooltips when hovering over keywords, such as 'ECO-EXPERT'
* having more payment options
* highlighting the filter that's been applied in the webshop - it seems that the breadcrumbs (where this information is currently displayed) are often overlooked or users simply don't look there to find this information

### Bugs, Problems and Vulnerabilities

**Loyalty Programme**

The most challenging task for this project was to think of and create the logic for the loyalty programme. After discussing
with my mentor about the possibilities it was clear that this should be connected to user profiles. For that reason I've decided
to simply implement the points tracking as part of the user profile and extended the `UserProfile` model.

The biggest challenge was writing the code that would track the points automatically whenever an order has been made. Several tutors
from CodeInstitute and I tried to think of solutions, but we kept running into errors or problems until we've come up with an idea that
the loyalty points should be added to the `UserProfile` whenever an order has been placed instead of attaching them to the orders and pulling
the data from orders. This serves the purpose of this MVP well and it was very easy and quick to implement it.

This solution, however, causes one issue, which is that if the order confirmation page is refreshed or accessed again after the 
checkout, the points will be added to the profile again. This shouldn't be happening as users could manipulate the system to get more
points. In the long run, loyalty programme would definitely need a makeover.

This also means that if an order is placed by accident and the user gets in touch with the customer service to delete the order, the
order will be deleted but the points would have to be manually removed from the profile by admins.

Loyalty programme currently doesn't have a time limit. I've imagined it to be reset every year but haven't had the time to implement this
into the system. At the moment, users can keep ordering and collecting points without an end to it.

**Webhooks**

Another challenge I've come across were webhooks. I deployed the project to Heroku with automatic e-mails in place so everytime
I ordered something in the development mode, the order would be made in the database of the deployed project. This caused confirmation
e-mails being sent out with a different order ID and wrongly calculated costs - as the costs depend on user's loyalty points (such as,
10% discount and free shipping for level-2 and level-3 users).

Luckily, a CodeInstitute's tutor was familiar with the issue, so I was assured everything would be all right for the deployed project.

**Cross-Browser CSS Issues**

For my previous project, I manually added all the browser prefixes whenever I came across a problem. It was a long, exhausting
process, so I was very happy when I was pointed to [Autoprefixer](https://autoprefixer.github.io/).

Autoprefixer saved me a lot of time and efforts right from the beginning and there was only one outline that I had to fix
for Safari browser.
