# ECOSiO - E-Commerce Web App With Eco-Friendly Cosmetics For Men

Code Institute - Final Milestone Project (4) - Full Stack Frameworks With Django

ECOSiO is a multi-page e-commerce web application with a mission to make eco-friendly cosmetics easily available. 
The application focuses on men as target audience and offers a variety of products and content connected to sustainable
lifestyle. The primary purpose of this web app is to provide a trusted marketplace for men interested in sustainability,
environmental issues and personal well-being. ECOSiO's core belief is that both environment and health always come first, 
and we should never be forced to choose one or another. 

As ECOSiO's vision is to revolutionise cosmetic industry from head to toe, the web app is strengthened by having 
features such as blog and loyalty programme. Sustainability can be an overwhelming and, quite often, an expensive choice,
therefore these features support the secondary purpose of the app which is helping customers to stay on the right track and enjoy 
the shopping experience. The idea behind this web app is not to provide a one-time shopping solution but to create a community 
of loyal customers.

Apart from the customer-facing UI, users with admin rights can interact with the web app as well. Although the majority of the
interaction is done through [the Django admin site](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/ref/contrib/admin/), the web app 
provides more pleasant environment for common tasks such as adding, editing and deleting products or blog posts.

**IMPORTANT: This project contains real products from existing brands. Please visit their websites for more information if you
wish to purchase them. Read more about how and why I've used them for this project in the 'Credits' section.**

## UX

Who are 'green' consumers and why are they so interesting for this project? In [Green Consumerism: An A-to-Z Guide](https://sk.sagepub.com/reference/greenconsumerism/n71.xml)
green consumer has been defined as "_someone who is aware of his or her obligation to protect the environment by selectively purchasing
green products or services. A green consumer tries to maintain a healthy and safe lifestyle without endangering the sustainability of the 
planet and the future of mankind._" According to [GfK](https://digital.gfk.com/understanding-todays-green-consumer), the segment of customers
impacted by the eco-conscious trend has been steadily rising over the past years - from 53% of the overall customers in 2009 to 61% customers 
in 2019. The percentage is particularly high for younger customers, such as Millennials, according to [Global Web Index](https://blog.globalwebindex.com/chart-of-the-week/green-consumerism/).

However, [White, Hardisty and Habib](https://hbr.org/2019/07/the-elusive-green-consumer) write about a fascinating problem when it comes to
green consumers' buying behaviour. It seems that 65% of people say they want to buy purpose-driven brands that advocate sustainability, 
yet only about 26% actually do so. They have been studying how to encourage sustainable consumption for several years, performing their 
own experiments and reviewing research in marketing, economics, and psychology. When it comes to men and sustainability in particular, 
the authors have found out that "some men associate sustainability with femininity, leading them to avoid sustainable options."

What about men and cosmetics? According to [National Retail Federation](https://nrf.com/blog/rise-mens-cosmetics-and-brands-making-their-mark),
men's cosmetics is on the rise as a separate segment of the beauty industry. In the US alone, the revenue forecast for men's skincare products 
is expected [to grow to USD 18.92 billion by 2027.](https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/mens-skincare-products-market) However,
one of the major obstacles when it comes to encouraging men to buy cosmetics is in fact similar to the one mentioned earlier - [Blanchin, Chareyron and Levert](http://www.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:238020/FULLTEXT01.pdf)
write that brands need to fight the widely spread belief that cosmetics is only for women in order to attract male customers.

### Conclusion of the Research

[White, Hardisty and Habib](https://hbr.org/2019/07/the-elusive-green-consumer) give a great example of how Tesla markets its environmentally
friendly cars - "Tesla focuses on the innovative design and functional performance of its cars more than on their green credentials â€” a message
that resonates with its target market. _This also helps overcome the concern of some men that green products are feminine._" Similarly, 
men's cosmetic industry is fighting that through [design and brand modifications.](https://nrf.com/blog/rise-mens-cosmetics-and-brands-making-their-mark)
It is clear that both of these industries rely heavily on the way the product is presented to the audience, as well as that they need much
stronger prompts and incentives to start the customer buying journey than other e-commerce businesses.

The growing interest in both of these topics indicates a promising potential for business development. On the one hand, sustainability is 
already widely spread as an interest but the users lack encouragement towards paying for such services. On the other hand, men's cosmetics 
as an industry is blooming but it still encounters obstacles, such as associating cosmetics with women.

Since brand identity and incentives seem to be crucial for the user experience (along with the standard features related to e-commerce sites) 
these were my two major focuses throughout the project - how to present well a marketplace for cosmetics to male audience, and how to encourage 
audience interested in sustainability to enter the shopping behaviour.
