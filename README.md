# ECOSiO - E-Commerce Web App With Eco-Friendly Cosmetics For Men

Code Institute - Final Milestone Project (4) - Full Stack Frameworks With Django

ECOSiO is a multi-page e-commerce web application with a mission to make eco-friendly cosmetics easily available. 
The application focuses on men as target audience and offers a variety of products and content connected to sustainable
lifestyle. The primary purpose of this web app is to provide a trusted marketplace for men interested in sustainability,
environmental issues and personal well-being. ECOSiO's core belief is that both environment and health always come first, 
and we should never be forced to choose one or another. 

As ECOSiO's vision is to revolutionise cosmetic industry from head to toe, the web app is strengthened by having 
features such as blog and loyalty programme. Sustainability can be an overwhelming and, quite often, an expensive choice,
therefore these features support the secondary purpose of the app which is helping customers to stay on the right track and enjoy 
the shopping experience. The idea behind this web app is not to provide a one-time shopping solution but to create a community 
of loyal customers.

Apart from the customer-facing UI, users with admin rights can interact with the web app as well. Although the majority of the
interaction is done through [the Django admin site](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/ref/contrib/admin/), the web app 
provides more pleasant environment for common tasks such as adding, editing and deleting products or blog posts.
